# Real-time_Facial_Detect_Insightface-paddle

This repo refers to [Insight_Face_Paddle](https://github.com/littletomatodonkey/insight-face-paddle) and [Real-time Multi-Camera Facial Recognition](https://github.com/M-M-Akash/Face_Recognition_System). These two repos have a few lib incompatible problems and that is why I bulid this repo to deliver a proper way to build up.

## Enviroment

It is not recommended to use M-series processor for MacOS as base enviroment for the reason that it may report lots of incompatible problems in spite of the compatible announcement from officail website. Win10 and Ubuntu 22.04 are recommended and this repo is operated on ubuntu 22.04 desktop system. 

Using conda to build virtual environment:

```linux
conda create --name env_name python==3.8
```
